Dear hakkers,

We are pleased to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.5. This release mostly contains small fixes across the board
and continued work on Akka Typed. Some notable improvements and bug fixes in 2.5.12 are:

- Addition of java.time.Duration to Java APIs, more will follow [#24646](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/24646), thanks to [@hepin1989](https://github.com/hepin1989) and [@ralphlaude](https://github.com/ralphlaude)
- PatternCS.ask overload taking a function from ActorRef was not used by compiler [#24587](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/24587)

- Many small improvements of Akka Typed, and some API changes, see below

A total of 98 issues were closed since 2.5.11. The complete list can be found on the [2.5.12 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/128?closed=1) on github.

## API changes in Akka Typed

We have done some additional API changes to Akka Typed since 2.5.11. Sorry for the inconvenience but it should be a straight forward find-replace migration.

Renames:

- `Behaviors.immutable` -> `Behaviors.receive`
- `Behaviors.immutablePartial` -> `Behaviors.receivePartial`
- `Behaviors.onSignal` -> `Behaviors.receiveSignal`
- `Behaviors.immutable` ... `onSignal` -> `Behaviors.receive` ... `receiveSignal`
- `Behaviors.mutable` -> `Behaviors.setup`
- `Behaviors.MutableBehavior` -> `MutableBehavior` (top level class)
- `ExtensibleBehavior.receiveMessage` -> `ExtensibleBehavior.receive`

New:

- `Behaviors.receiveMessage` (similar to Behaviors.receive, but handling only the message, no context)
- `Behaviors.receiveMessagePartial`

See issue [#24683](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/24683)
