Dear hakkers,

we are happy to announce Akka Http 10.1.0-RC2, the second release candidate for the upcoming Akka HTTP 10.1.0 release.
We focused on stabilizing the new client connection pool. Over the last month our test suite caught lots of edge cases
that were fixed for this release. Also, we improved logging output for the new pool.

We also merged a lot of small (but valuable!) contributions.

Please try out the new release candidate, especially for client usages, so that we gain confidence for releasing
the final release.

Note, that OSGI support was removed from the build starting with 10.1.0-RC1 because the sbt OSGI plugin once
again broke the release process. If you care for OSGI support of Akka HTTP binaries, please [step up](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1852)
to reestablish and maintain Akka Http's OSGI support.

### List of changes

#### Improvements

##### akka-http-core

 * Optimization: Avoid creation of async callback per request in RequestTimeoutStage ([#1848](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1848))
 * Add `application/grpc+proto` content type / media type ([#1844](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1844))
 * LogByteStringTools now logs errors on debug log (it's a debug feature after all) ([#1780](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1780))
 * Suggest valid max-open-requests values on config error ([#1806](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1806))

 * Be more lenient to allow trailing whitespace after chunk size ([#1812](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1812))
 * In `Http().serverLayer` use `delayCancellation` to make behavior consistent with other server entry points ([#1822](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1822))

##### akka-http
