Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce Akka Http 10.0.9, which is the ninth release of the Akka Http 10.0 series. This maintenance release fixes a regression in 10.0.8 that occurred when using media ranges and connecting to a HTTP server that fails to specify the charset in the `ContentType` [#1222](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1222).

Additionally, support for HTTP status code 418 has been introduced [#1206](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1206)

## Credits

A total 3 issues were closed since 10.0.8.

The complete list of closed issues can be found on the [10.0.9](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/28?closed=1) milestones on GitHub.

For this release we had the help of 5 contributors – thank you all very much!
